#' Enum to describe possible sexes in an insurance contract or tariff.
#'
#' @details

#' * "unisex"

#'

#' Enum to define how much of a contract needs to be calculated automatically.
#'
#' @details
#' When an [InsuranceContract] object is created, all time series are immediately
#' calculated. However, sometimes, one only needs part of the values, so it
#' would be a waste of resources to calculate e.g. all future reserves and
#' profit participation, if only premiums are of interest.
#'
#' Possible values are:
#' * "all"
#' * "probabilities"
#' * "cashflows"
#' * "presentvalues"
#' * "premiums"
#' * "absvalues"
#' * "reserves"
#' * "premiumcomposition"

#' Enum to define the different components of profit participation.
#'
#' @details
#' Profit participation schemes typically consist of different components,
#' which are calculated independently. Typical components are interest profit
#' to distribute investment gains to the customer, risk profit and expense profit
#' to return security margins in the biometric risk and the expenses to the customer
#' and sum profit, which aplies to contracts with higher sums insured, where
#' charged expenses are calculated from the sum insured, while the actual
#' expenses are more or less constant. Thus, high contracts are charged more,
#' which causes profits that are returned as sum profit.
#'
#' As a special case, part of the profits can be stored in a terminal bonus
#' reserve and only distributed on maturity (or potentially on death), but
#' not on surrender. Some (older) profit participation schemes add an independently
#' calculated bonus on maturity (e.g. twice the total profit assignment of the
#' last year) at maturity to give customers an additional incentive not to
#' surrender a contract.
#'
#' Possible values are (multiple can be given):
#' * "interest"
#' * "risk"
#' * "expense"
#' * "sum"
#' * "terminal"
#' * "TBF"
#'

#' Defines a frequency charge (surcharge for monthly/quarterly/semiannual) premium payments
#'
#' @description Tariffs are typically calculated with yearly premium installments. When
#' premiums are paid more often then one a year (in advance), the insurance
#' receives part of the premium later (or not at all in case of death), so a
#' surcharge for premium payment frequencies higher than yearly is applied to
#' the  premium, typically in the form of a percentage of the premium.
#'
#' This function generates the internal data structure to define surcharges for
#' monthly, quarterly and semiannual premium payments. The given surcharges can
#' be either given as percentage points (e.g. 1.5 means 1.5% = 0.015) or as
#' fractions of 1 (i.e. 0.015 also means 1.5% surcharge). The heuristics applied
#' to distinguish percentage points and fractions is that all values larger than 0.1
#' are understood as percentage points and values 0.1 and lower are understood
#' as fractions of 1.
#' As a consequence, a frequency charge of 10% or more MUST be given as percentage points.
#'
#' Currently, the frequency charges are internally represented as a named list,
#' \code{list("1" = 0, "2" = 0.01, "4" = 0.02, "12" = 0.03)}, but that might
#' change in the future, so it is advised to use this function rather than
#' explicitly using the named list in your code.
#'
#' @param monthly Surcharge for monthly premium payments
#' @param quarterly Surcharge for quarterly premium payments
#' @param semiannually Surcharge for semi-annual premium payments
#' @param yearly Surcharge for yearly premium payments (optiona, default is no surcharge)
#' @returns a named list of surcharges for names 1 (yearly), 2 (semiannually), 4 (quarterly) and 12 (monthly) payments

#' Expect approximate equality by absolute tolerance

#'
#' @param object Expression or value producing the actual result.
#' @param expected Expression or value producing the reference result.
#'   If `expected` is `NULL` or entirely `NA`, the expectation succeeds
#'   silently (useful when reference data are not available).
#' @param ... Additional arguments forwarded to [waldo::compare()] for
#'   generating diffs in failure messages (not used in the tolerance check).
#' @param tolerance A non-negative numeric scalar. The maximum allowed
#'   absolute difference per element. Default: `0.01`.
#' @param info A character string appended to the failure message.

#'   `object` and `expected`. By default they are derived from the expressions.
#'
#' @details
#' The comparison is vectorised and applies the rule `abs(x - y) <= tolerance`
#' element-wise. All elements must satisfy the rule for the expectation to pass.

#' Test profit participation values against reference data
